# How to Echolocate

Stewart wants to make a game about bats and echolocation. This is our planning
document.

## Brainstorming

What kind of game is this?

According to Stewart:

* You choose your bat.
* You can choose if it's a male or a female.
* Then you go out on your first adventure.
  - Your first adventure is a test.
  - It's a test to see if you can dodge predators.
  - You see a red "X" coming up to represent predators.
* How you fly:
  - You use `W` to fly forward.
  - `S` to fly backward.
  - `Q` to fly diagonally.
  - `R` to fly to the right.
  - `H` to fly to the left.
* You use the spacebar to echolocate.
  - You see a sound coming towards you.
  - You can read the sound because it has words.
  - Then you know if it's a bug or predator.
* Any hollow tree you see you will be able to rest in.
  - You will know if it is hollow or not because you'll see an "H" on the front
    of the tree.
* To sleep, you use `B`.
* And, yeah, that's a lot you need to know!

Daddy's questions:

* What happens if a predator gets you?
  - You die and go back to a saving spot.
* Are you trying to get as many bugs as possible? Or do you only need enough to
  not be hungry?
  - You try to get as many bugs as possible.
  - You see hearts for how much you will eat.
    * When you eat a bug, you get a heart.
    * You can get as many hearts as you want.
    * You lose all your hearts if you're dead.
* How does the game end? Or does it?
  - There is a goal you're trying to reach, but then the adventure just starts
    over again.
  - The goal is: **to get from your hollow tree and then try to get to the forest
    without being dead** (only if you get a saving spot from predators you'll be
    able to reach your goal still).
* Is there any difference if you choose a male or a female bat?
  - If you choose a female bat you have babies and get to start over again when
    you reach the goal.
  - If you choose a male bat you don't get to start over again.
